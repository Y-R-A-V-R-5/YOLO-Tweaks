# 🧠 YOLO-Tweaks: Backbone–Head Hybrid Compatibility Experiments Across YOLOv8 / YOLOv10 / YOLOv11

> **Project Status:** Complete | **Dataset:** AgriPest (Tiny-Object) | **Key Finding:** Hybrid **v10v11** achieves near-YOLOv8 accuracy with 32% fewer parameters.

## 🚀 Research Overview

This independent study investigates the **structural modularity and scaling behavior** of modern YOLO architectures. By treating YOLO versions (v8, v10, v11) not as fixed models, but as modular systems, we created hybrid architectures (e.g., v10 Backbone + v11 Head) to identify novel performance and efficiency trade-offs on a challenging, **tiny-object** dataset.

The core hypothesis tested is whether architectural efficiency modules (from v10/v11) can be successfully combined with robust feature extraction mechanisms (from v8) to create a new Pareto-optimal model.

## 🎯 Objectives & Hybrid Model Space

## 🔍 Key Research Findings & Discussion

### 1. Hybrid Optimization Success
The **v10v11** hybrid (YOLOv10 Backbone + YOLOv11 Head) is the most significant finding. It achieved a $\text{mAP50-95}$ of **0.409**, which is statistically indistinguishable from the leading YOLOv8 baseline ($\text{mAP50-95}=0.416$), yet it utilizes only **2.06 million parameters**—a **32% reduction** compared to YOLOv8's 3.01M. This confirms the efficacy of hybridization in finding a superior *theoretical* efficiency point.

### 2. Decoupling of Compute and Latency
A major counter-intuitive result is the lack of correlation between theoretical complexity (FLOPs/Params) and practical CPU inference latency:

* **YOLOv11** has the lowest FLOPs (6.5G) but is only marginally faster than the most parameter-heavy model ($\text{YOLOv8} \rightarrow 13.9\text{ms}$).
* The **v10v11** hybrid, with the lowest parameter count (2.06M), is the **slowest** model at $27.9\text{ms/img}$.

This is visually confirmed by the **Metric Correlation Heatmap**, which shows a high negative correlation ($\approx -0.89$) between **Parameters** and **Inference Time**. This suggests that on CPU hardware, architectural overhead, memory access patterns, and kernel optimization dominate the runtime cost over raw computation count.

### 3. Backbone–Head Synergy on Tiny Objects
Models leveraging the robust, dense-feature **YOLOv8 Head** (YOLOv8, v11v8) consistently delivered strong $\text{mAP50-95}$ performance, suggesting that for high-resolution, fine-grained tasks like tiny-object detection, the complexity of the feature aggregation head is more critical than the efficiency of the backbone.

## 📈 Visualizations

### Performance vs. Efficiency Trade-offs
These plots illustrate the classic trade-off space, showing how the models cluster. The ideal model would sit in the top-right (high accuracy) and bottom-left (low compute/latency) quadrants.

### Multi-Metric Comparison (Radar Plots)

#### Performance (Accuracy)
Larger area indicates higher overall detection performance. **YOLOv8** and the **v10v11** hybrid dominate the top quadrant.

#### Efficiency (Compute & Latency)
Lower values are better for efficiency. Note how the latency ($\text{Infer}(\text{ms})$) for the v10v11 hybrid drastically pulls its overall efficiency profile outwards, despite having the best parameters (Params(M)).

## 🔮 Future Work & Extensions

1.  **In-Depth Profiling:** Conduct detailed profiling (e.g., PyTorch Profiler, TensorBoard) specifically to diagnose the architectural causes of the $\text{Params}-\text{Inference}$ discrepancy observed on CPU hardware.
2.  **Pareto Frontier Analysis:** Plot the $\text{mAP50-95}$ vs. $\text{FLOPs}$ to formally identify which models occupy the Pareto Frontier for this tiny-object task.
3.  **Cross-Dataset Validation:** Replicate the experiment on a broader dataset (e.g., a COCO subset) to validate if the hybridization findings are generalizable beyond the AgriPest domain.
4.  **Hardware Benchmarking:** Benchmark the top hybrids on different hardware (e.g., GPU/Edge TPU) to see if the latency bottleneck is CPU-specific.

## 📚 Key Takeaways

* **Hybridization is Valid:** Recombining components across YOLO generations is a viable architectural research methodology.
* **The v10v11 Hybrid** provides a new, highly parameter-efficient architecture approaching state-of-the-art accuracy on tiny objects.
* **Theoretical vs. Real-World Efficiency:** Raw FLOPs/Parameter counts are insufficient predictors of latency on modern CPU hardware; deep architectural factors must be considered.
